# Extract from API - Transform -Load -InMemory DBatabase

## Abstract:
As a data scientist, we always will have to pull data from multiple sources and today most of the sources expose their data via APIs, so using data extractions via APIs is a skill that data scientist cannot live without. The data that comes from all these different sources that we need data from comes with its own challenges, as data scientist we will have to clean the data, clean for null values etc. Do transformations that we need to do, to make the data more meaningful or to make the data in the format that we want to work up on.
I believe that these skill are very important and very much needed and will be used almost every time as data scientist we look for data.
